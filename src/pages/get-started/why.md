To provide local producers with a unique, recognizable and environment-friendly brand designed to open
up new market opportunities and reinforce existing local businesses. Imports of agricultural produce has
increased dramatically in the last years from outside our borders, especially since the earthquake in 2015,
while local farmers continue to struggle on finding ways to market their own produce. Letâ€™s reverse this
tendency and be part of the change!

> Our vision for the future? To create a strong trademark recognized at national and even international level.
