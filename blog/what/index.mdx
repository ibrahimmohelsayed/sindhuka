Sindhuka is looking for local responsible farmers producing vegetables, fruits and herbal plantsâ€™ in a
sustainable and environment-friendly way. We promote a series of safe cultivation practices to respond to
the effects of climate change, minimizing the use of chemicals fertilizers and pesticides and using only local
varieties and eco-types. Our main goal here is to create a network of small-scale farmers in which all
together we can better market our products while promoting local food traditions.
